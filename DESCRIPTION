Description: Quantitative comparison of microbial composition from different populations is a fundamental task in various microbiome studies. The main goal of this package is to provide a new method for two-sample testing for microbial compositional data by leveraging the phylogenetic tree information. Empirical evidence from real data sets suggests that the phylogenetic microbial composition difference between two populations is usually  sparse. Motivated by this observation, this package implements a new maximum type test, Detector of Active Flow on a Tree (DAFOT). It is shown that DAFOT is particularly powerful against sparse phylogenetic composition  difference and enjoys certain optimality.
